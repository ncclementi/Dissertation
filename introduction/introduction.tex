\chapter{Introduction} \label{chap:intro}

A biosensor is a measuring device used to detect the presence or concentration of a biomolecule. The general system includes 
a probe with a sensitive biological receptor, a transducer and a detector. For the last three decades research in biosensing 
have experienced a rapid growth with applications in multiple areas like medical diagnoses, disease monitoring, drug delivery studies, 
and detection of biological agents \cite{Turner2000, Mohanty2006, Mehrotra2016}. Optical biosensors are a particular type of biosensors 
known for their sensitivity and real-time detection. Among many optical sensing techniques we have fluoresence, Raman spectroscopy, lithography, 
and surface plasmon resonance. One of the most used optical biosensors are the ones based on surface plasmon resonance (SPR) changes in thin gold films. These 
sensors exploit a particular type electromagnetic waves called surface plasmon polaritons for the detection of a biomolecule \cite{Homola2008}. However, when 
using metallic nanoparticles instead of thin films a powerful resonance peak shows in the visible range, and we called this phenomenon Localized Surface 
Plasmon Resonance (LSPR). When electromagnetic waves excite the free electrons on the surface of a conductive nanoparticle, they resonate with the incoming 
electric field forming plasmons, and most of the incoming energy is either absorbed by the nanoparticle, or scatter in multiple directions, both creating a 
large shadow behind the scatterer (a.k.a extinction cross section). In LSPR the resonance wavelength highly depends on the refraction index of the environment,
the geometry of the nanoparticle and its material. LSPR biosensors measure the shift in the plasmon resonance wavelength ($\Delta\lambda$) of the metallic 
nanoparticle as a biomolecule approaches to it. Biosensing based on LSPR has shown to be more precise and of high-sensitivity detection \cite{Sepulveda2009}, and
this technique has been used in multiple areas of biological detection such viruses and cancer \cite{Wang2010, Liu2014, Zhu2016}. 

The physics of localized surface plasmon resonance are modeled and solved by Maxwell's equations, and they are generally solved numerically 
by using using finite difference time-domain (FDTD), boundary element, or finite element methods \cite{SolisTaboadaObelleiroLiz-MaarzanGarciadeabajo2014}.
These methods have been used to study the optical properties of dielectric or metallic nanoparticles \cite{Hohenester2018,HohenesterTrugler2012,
JungPedersenSondergaardPedersenLarsenNielsen2010, VideenSun2003,MayergoyzFredkinZhang2005, MayergoyzZhang2007}, interactions between nanoparticles
and electron beams \cite{GarciadeabajoAizpurua1997, GarciadeabajoHowie2002}, and surface plasmon resonance sensors. However, for the latter application 
researchers use simple mathematical models for the interaction between the nanoparticle and the biomolecules, like representing the molecules as simple 
spheres \cite{DavisGomezVernon2010,AntosiewiczApellClaudioKall2011, SantiagoCordobaETal2011, ShenETal2013, UngerETal2009} or a prisms \cite{DanHu2014}, using 
constant real dielectrics for the analyte \cite{NghiemETal2012, SantiagoCordobaETal2011, ShenETal2013, UngerETal2009}, or representing the embedding medium 
and dissolved biomolecules with an effective permittivity \cite{JungCampbellChinowskyMarYee1998,WilletsVandyune2007,PhanETal2013}.

Progress in the field of biosensing is mainly developed through experimental research, which can be costly and time consuming. We believe that 
computational approaches could complement the design process and play a key role in the optimization of biosensors. Using computational approaches
can not only reduce the cost of the exploratory stages but also give access to details that are not always available in experimental settings. For example, 
the distance between the sensor and the biomolecule, the amount of analytes in the vicinity of the sensor and their orientation, and also other factors such like
the inclusion of the charges in the protein and the effects of the magnitude in the electric field when they are present. There are studies that show that 
the sensitivity of the sensor depends highly on the distance between the nanoparticle and the analyte \cite{HaesETal2004}. Other experimental studies complement
their results with models that ignore the presence of the biomolecules. Beuwer et al.~\cite{BeuwervanHoofZijlstra2018} and Henkel et al.~\cite{HenkelETal2018} 
used a boundary element method (BEM) in studies of the sensitivity of plasmonic sensors relying on (at least) two metallic nanoparticles 
(one on the sensor and one attached to the analyte). There is experimental evidence that shows that LSPR sensors are sensitive enough to detect conformational
changes in the biomolecules used as analytes \cite{HallETal2011}, having overly simplified models will imply not capturing such details. 

When the wavelength of the incoming field is much larger than the size of the nanoparticle ($\lambda>>d$), the physics of the optical phenomenon of 
localized surface plasmon resonance can be reduced to simply electrostatics. This approximation makes possible to use our boundary integral 
electrostatic solver \pygbe to compute the extinction cross section of metallic or dielectric nanoparticles, and to study how the LSPR response varies in the 
presence of a biomolecule. In this work we present results on how sensitivity is affected by the distance between the sensor and the analyte in LSPR biosensors, 
how the geometrical model of the biomolecule and its orientation affects the LSPR response, the impacts of using real versus dielectric models for both 
the analyte and the embedding medium, as well as how the effects of including charges in the protein model and how the electric field magnitude
plays a role in it.

\pygbe is a Python implementation of continuum electrostatic theory that relies on the boundary element method, its original application included 
the computing of solvation energy of biomolecular systems \cite{CooperBardhanBarba2013}, and the studying of protein orientation near charged 
nanosurfaces \cite{CooperClementiBarba2015}. In 2017 we extended \pygbe to the field of nanoplasmonics, by treating localized surface plasmon resonance 
(LSPR) quasistatically \cite{ClementiETal2017}. The boundary element solver in \pygbe is accelerated algorithmically via a treecode, an $\mathcal{O}(N\log N)$ 
fast-summation method, and on hardware by taking advantage of graphic processing units (GPUs). This allows us to handle problems in the order of half a million 
boundary elements, or more, thus being able to use the explicit representation of the biomolecular surface. There are other research softwares that could be use 
for this application, like BEM++ \cite{SmigajETal2015} and a Matlab toolbox called MNPBEM \cite{HohenesterTrugler2012}, which have the capability to solve the 
full Maxwell's equations and the electrostatic approximation in the long-wavelength limit. However, we believe in both cases the size of the problems, in terms of
number of boundary elements, they can solve, may not be enough to resolve the details of the biomolecules. 
 
To the best of our knowledge, \pygbe is the only open-source software that uses a fast algorithm ($\mathcal{O}(N\log N)$),
for $N$ unknownsâ€”and hardware acceleration on GPUs to compute the extinction cross-sections of arbitrary geometries to explore
nanophotonics applications in the quasistatic limit. Our software it is openly developed via its repository on 
Github (\url{https://github.com/barbagroup/pygbe}), it has been verified \ref{sec:verification} against an analytical solution based 
on the Mie theory for silver nanospheres, validated against experimental results of reflectance of localized surface phonon polariton 
(SPhP) nanostructures from Ellis et al. \ref{ssec:validation}, and we share it under the BSD 3-clause license.
