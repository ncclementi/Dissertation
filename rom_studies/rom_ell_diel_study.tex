\chapter{Effects of a reduced order model for protein representation}
\graphicspath{{rom_studies/figs/}}

Part of the process of computational modelling is making assumptions about the problem we are trying to solve. In the 
field of localized surface plasmon resonance for biosensing applications there are several reports that use Bovine Serum Albumin 
as an analyte to simulate the behavior of a bioconjugate sensor. However, they use a simplified model
of the protein, and often a real-valued dielectric for the medium. Some use a model that is 
a layer of protein-water solution \cite{PhanETal2013}, 
or just a protein dielectric layer \cite{NghiemETal2012}, others model the
protein as a triangular prism \cite{DanHu2014}, or even a small sphere with a 
constant dielectric \cite{SantiagoCordobaETal2011, UngerETal2009}. Phan and 
coworkers \cite{PhanETal2013} present a Lorentz-Drude model for the complex 
dielectric of the BSA which we use in our work, while most of the literature 
use a constant dielectric with no losses to represent the BSA 
(refractive index of $n= 1.9$ \cite{NghiemETal2012}, $n= 1.45$ \cite{SantiagoCordobaETal2011}) or
other proteins used as analytes ($n=1.58$ polystrene \cite{UngerETal2009}, $n=1.57$ 
streptavidin \cite{ShenETal2013}). 

Research shows that the shape of both monomer and dimmer of BSA are prolate ellipsoids 
\cite{MoserETal1966, SquireETal1968, WrightETal1975}. However, we have not seen in the literature the use of ellipsoids 
to model the protein in the computational approaches. Our BSA model, based on its crystal 
structure, is a good reference of the actual shape of the protein. We 
explore the effects of using reduced-order models for the protein representation like ellipsoids and spheres. We compared 
the results with the full model, and study the consequences of these simplifications. We also studied the effects of the model chosen 
for the charges inside the protein (full distribution, monopole equivalent charge, and no charges), the protein orientation, the 
amount of proteins in the vicinity of the nanoparticle, the magnitude of the incident electric field, the value and type (complex or real)
of the protein and water medium dielectrics. 

To the best of our knowledge, there is no model in the literature that counts for the charges inside the protein. 
Moreover, there are no study that explore the effects of using reduced-order models for the protein representations 
in computational models. This chapter cover the results of using different assumptions in the modelling process and what 
are the implications of them.

\section{BSA as a prolate ellipsoid}

The crystal structure of the BSA (pdb 4f5s) used in our simulations corresponds
to a dimer. Knowing that this structure can be modeled as an ellipsoid \cite{SquireETal1968},
we look for different alternatives to decide the dimensions of the ellipsoid. We took two
different approaches, a surface model and a volume model. The first attempt is 
the surface model which consists on finding the dimensions
of an ellipsoid that encapsules all the charges within the protein. We determined the principal axes of this
ellipsoid using Principal Component Analysis. Principal component analysis is a technique that
uses orthogonal transformations and brings out patterns in a set of data. When 
we use a PCA in three dimensions, these transformations ensure that the first 
component is the one with most variation, the second one is the second-most, and
third one the least. This technique provided us the three eigenvectors that best 
describe the cloud of mesh-vertices. The values of the principal axis are $a=98.9\, \text{\AA}$, $b=54.2\, \text{\AA}$, and $c=41.8\, \text{\AA}$. 
Using these vectors when creating the mesh of the ellipsoid ensures that all the charges are contained.
The second approach to model the BSA is to create an ellipsoid that matches the volume of the BSA. To find the dimensions 
of the volume-equivalent equivalent we made some approximations. We obtained the volume of the BSA protein original mesh
using Trimesh (\url{https://github.com/mikedh/trimesh})), and looking at the PCA principal axis we notice that $b$ and $c$ are close 
compared to $a$, then $b=c=x$ and $a$ is double the size $a=2x$, agreeing with the results from Squire and co-workers
\cite{SquireETal1968}. Using these approximations we can write the volume of the ellipsoid:

\begin{equation}
    V_e = \frac{4\pi}{3}a\,b\,c 
\end{equation}

as 

\begin{equation}
    V_e = \frac{4\pi}{3}2\,x^3
\end{equation}

Knowing that the volume of the volume of the BSA protein is $V_e = 166642 \, \text{\AA}^3$ we get that $x=27.09496 \, \text{\AA}$ 
and therefore $a=54.18993 \, \text{\AA}$ and $b=c=27.09496 \, \text{\AA}$. These dimensions give us an ellipsoid that hast the same volume 
as the original BSA mesh, however, we can not encapsule all the charges inside of it. To be able to use this model we needed to study first the 
effects of replacing the distribution of charges by a monopole, as well as the possibility of not include them in the model. 

\subsection{Effect of charges within the protein}

Since the PCA model can encapsuled all the charges we intended to use this model to study the effect of using the charges distribution, versus
a monopole representation of the charges ("center of mass"), and also no charges present. To ensure that we are solving the equations properly, 
we perform a convergence analysis.


\subsubsection{PCA ellipsoid convergence analysis}

We performed a grid convergence analysis on the PCA (Principal component analysis) ellipsoid - sensor system containing a full pqr (see Figure \ref{fig:one_pca_sketch}). 
Since we compute the extinction cross section of the sensor (8 nm radius silver sphere), we set a fixed mesh density for the ellipsoid and refine 
the mesh of the sphere ($N=512, 2048, 8192, 32768$). We found that a mesh with $N=5120$ elements for the ellipsoid was fine enough for the convergence analysis.
We used the same physical conditions and parameters that were used for the BSA-nanoparticle convergence analysis presented in
\ref{sec:grid_conv_bsa}. Similarly to the BSA-sensor system, the distance between the sensor and the PCA-ellipsoid 
was $d=1$ nm, and the ellipsoid was oriented such that the dipole moment of the charges was aligned with the $y$-axis. To obtain the error 
estimate we used Richardson extrapolated value of the extinction cross section as a reference, $C_{ext} = 1432.6560$ nm$^2$.
The observed order of convergence is $0.99$, and Figure \ref{fig:err_sph-pca} shows that the error decays with the number of boundary elements ($1/N$). This provides
evidence that the numerical solutions computed with \pygbe are correctly resolved by the meshes.  Table \ref{table:err_sph-pca} shows the percentages error for the different 
meshes used in this study.

     $32768$ & $0.42$ \\
    \hline%\bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

After performing the convergence analysis studies, we relaxed the numerical parameters of the computations to reduce the run-time without 
compromising accuracy. The following parameters were used to obtain all non-convergence results presented from now on for the case of PCA ellipsoids.

\end{table}

The Richardson extrapolated value for the PCA case is: $1432.6561$ nm$^2$ and the computed value with the relaxed parameters 
is $1456.0781$ nm$^2$. If we compute the percentage error we obtain $1.63 \%$.

\subsubsection{Charges model analysis} \label{ssub:pqr_analysis}

In order to know if we could use a VE approach we studied the effect of the charges inside the protein. We analyzed
the different representations of pqr (full distribution and equivalent monopole) as well as the impact of having
no charges present. The setup of the simulations consists in a silver sphere sensor ($r=8$ nm) with a PCA ellipsoid 
at 1 nm of the surface of the sensor in the $z$-direction, oriented such that the dipole moment is aligned with the $y$-axis. We run 
three different cases, one with the full charges distribution, a second case with one equivalent charge located in the
"center of mass" (See Figure \ref{fig:one_pca_cm_sketch}), and lastly an empty ellipsoid with no charges. Figure 
\ref{fig:pqr_pca} shows the results for the different models of the charge distribution as well as the results when 
there are no charges present within the ellipsoid. 

\begin{figure}%[h] %  figure placement: here, top, bottom, or page

    the label "GC" indicates the geometric center for reference.}
    \label{fig:one_pca_cm_sketch}
 \end{figure}

    silver sphere immersed in water with one PCA ellipsoid at $1$ nm away from 
    the surface in the $z$-direction, under a constant electric field on the $z$-direction.
    The label "Full pqr" corresponds to the full distribution of charges, the label "CM pqr" corresponds to a monopole representation 
    of the charges obtained by computing the center of mass of them, and the label "No pqr" 
    corresponds to the case where there are no charges present.}
    \label{fig:pqr_pca}
 \end{figure}

 The maximum value for all the curves in Figure \ref{fig:pqr_pca} occurs at $385.25$ nm. The 
 maximum value of the extinction cross section for the full distribution ("Full pqr") is $3827.06$ nm$^2$ and for 
 the monopole/center-of-mass representation ("CM pqr") is $3828.21$ nm$^2$, what results in a difference of $0.03 \,\%$. The
 maximum value of the extinction cross section when there are no charges present ("No pqr") is $3755.51$ nm$^2$ which compared to 
 the maximum for the full distribution gives us a difference of $1.87 \,\%$. Looking at these results we can say that the presence of 
 charges inside the protein does not affect the wavelength shift. However, it does affect the intensity of the maximum value of the 
 extinction cross section by approximately $2 \,\%$. Finally, we can say that using a monopole approximation for the distribution of charges, 
 is equivalent to using the full distribution of charges.

\subsection{Surface equivalent vs Volume equivalent} \label{ssec:surf_vol_ell}

In section \ref{ssub:pqr_analysis} we show that using a monopole approximation is equivalent to using the full distribution of charges. This 
allow us to explore the effects of the volume equivalent model. Similarly to the PCA case we need to perform convergence analysis for
the volume equivalent case, we present the results of the convergence analysis in section \ref{sssec:ve_conv}. Following the convergence 
study of the volume equivalent ellipsoid we present, in section \ref{sssec:ell_mod_comp}, the comparison of the PCA ellipsoid model and the volume equivalent 
model with the original BSA protein structure model, replicating the configuration shown in Figure \ref{fig:display_z}. 


\subsubsection{Volume Equivalent ellipsoid convergence analysis}\label{sssec:ve_conv}

We performed a grid convergence analysis on the VE (volume equivalent) ellipsoid - sensor system containing a monopole charge located 
in the center of mass of the charge distribution. (see Figure \ref{fig:one_ve_sketch}). Since we compute the extinction cross section of the sensor 
(8 nm radius silver sphere), we set a fixed mesh density for the ellipsoid and refine 
the mesh of the sphere ($N=512, 2048, 8192, 32768$). We found that a mesh with $N=1280$ elements for the ellipsoid was fine enough for the convergence analysis.
We used the same physical conditions and parameters that were used for the BSA-nanoparticle convergence analysis presented in
\ref{sec:grid_conv_bsa}. Similarly to the BSA-sensor system, the distance between the sensor and the VE-ellipsoid 
was $d=1$ nm, and the ellipsoid was oriented such that the dipole moment of the charges was aligned with the $y$-axis. To obtain the error 
estimate we used Richardson extrapolated value of the extinction cross section as a reference, $C_{ext} = 1683.8117$ nm$^2$.
The observed order of convergence is $0.99$, and Figure \ref{fig:err_sph-ve} shows that the error decays with the number of boundary elements ($1/N$). This provides
evidence that the numerical solutions computed with \pygbe are correctly resolved by the meshes.  Table \ref{table:err_sph-ve} shows the percentages error for the different 
meshes used in this study.

     $32768$ & $0.45$ \\
    \hline%\bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

After performing the convergence analysis studies, we relaxed the numerical parameters of the computations to reduce the run-time without 
compromising accuracy. We use the parameters from Table \ref{table:rel_pca_par} to obtain all non-convergence results presented from 
now on for the case of VE ellipsoids. The Richardson extrapolated value for the VE case is: $1683.8117$ nm$^2$ and the computed value with 
the relaxed parameters is $1713.1972$ nm$^2$. If we compute the percentage error we obtain $1.75 \%$.

\subsubsection{Ellipsoid model vs original BSA}\label{sssec:ell_mod_comp}

In Figure \ref{fig:2pz_ell_resp} we show the results of comparing both ellipsoidal models of the protein with the 
original representation of the protein obtained from the crystal structure. We present the LSPR response 
of the system showed in Figure \ref{fig:display_z}, and for the ellipsoidal models we use an equivalent 
setup that replaces the proteins, located at $\pm 1$ nm in the $z$-direction, for the respective ellipsoids.
Both the PCA and VE model contain a monopole charge in the center of mass of the distribution.

\begin{figure} %[h] %  figure placement: here, top, bottom, or page
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{two_ell_analysis.pdf} 
    \caption{Extinction cross-section as a function of wavelength for a 8 nm silver sphere immersed 
    in water with two BSA proteins ("BSA"), two PCA-ellipsoids with one equivalent charge ("PCA"), and two
    volume equivalent ellipsoids ("VE") with one equivalent charge. In all cases the proteins or equivalents
    are placed at $\pm 1$ nm away from the surface in the $z$-direction, except for the case where there is 
    no protein ("Sensor").}
    \label{fig:2pz_ell_resp}
 \end{figure}

Looking at the results on the figure we can say that the model chosen to represent the analytes matters. The PCA model (surface based model, 
surface of PCA is $1.14$ times the original surface) over estimates the LSPR response, by giving us a shift of $2.5$ nm 
($400$ $\%$ more) than the original shift ($0.5$ nm). The VE model (volume based based) shift it is still bigger ($0.75$ nm) than the original 
by $50$ $\%$, but we can say that a reduced order model based on the volume is a closer representation of the full protein. In both cases we can see 
that the intensity of the peak decreases. This can be a problem, along with the overestimation of the shift,
if the results are intended to be used in the computation of sensitivity. The Figure of Merit is usually how a
nanoparticle's sensing capabilities is characterized, and it is defined as the ratio between the 
sensitivity ($S = \Delta \lambda / \Delta n$) over the full width mid hight (FWMH) \cite{otte2012}. Making 
conclusion of sensitive capabilities of a sensors, based on models that under estimate the magnitude of the peak and 
overestimate the shift can lead to incorrect assessments.

In summary, using an ellipsoidal shape of equivalent surface that contains all the charges is not a good approximation
since it overestimates the shift considerably. The VE-equivalent model exhibits a shift of $0.75$ nm, which is still  
an overestimated the response. However, we believe that the volume equivalent approximation can be used to investigate 
qualitative behaviors, and take advantage of the less expensive simulations to get insights on the physics of problems 
that might not be possible to simulate due to memory restrictions.

\subsection{Other model considerations}

Besides studying the effect of choosing a surface versus a volume based model as an approximation of protein, there are other
factors that can affect the behavior of the system sensor-BSA. In this section we present the results of choosing a spherical 
geometry instead of an ellipsoidal model, the results of the protein orientation, the number of proteins in the vicinity of the nanoparticle, and 
the effect of the magnitude of the incident electric field. 

\subsubsection{Sphere vs Ellipsoid for protein modeling}

Spheres are one of the geometries used in the literature to represent the protein \cite{SantiagoCordobaETal2011, UngerETal2009}. In this 
section we compare a spherical volume-equivalent model with the ellipsoidal volume-equivalent model used in section
\ref{ssec:surf_vol_ell}. Figures \ref{fig:sph_vs_ell_ve} shows the different LSPR responses of a silver nanoparticle of $8$ nm of radius, 
for the different models. The peak for both the ellipsoid and the sphere of equivalent volume, happens at $384.75$ nm, and the 
maximum extinction cross section is nearly the same for both cases (difference $<$0.5$\%$). For the sphere simulations 
the monopole charge was located at the geometric center, we run simulations on a volume-equivalent ellipsoid that show 
that locating the monopole charge at the geometric center compared to the center of mass, does not cause a shift on the peak 
and the difference between the intensities at the peak is $<1\%$.


\begin{figure} %[h] %  figure placement: here, top, bottom, or page
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{two_ve_ell_sph_vs_BSA.pdf} 
    \caption{Extinction cross-section as a function of wavelength for an $8$ nm
    silver sphere immersed in water, under a constant electric field, with two volume equivalent 
    ellipsoids/spheres placed $\pm 1$ nm away from the surface in the $z$-direction.}
    \label{fig:sph_vs_ell_ve}
 \end{figure}

We still have the problem of over estimating the shift by $50$ $\%$ compared to the BSA protein original mesh, 
and at first sight we can consider this model comparable to the ellipsoidal volume-equivalent one. However, 
when we use a spherical model for the protein we lose any information regarding the orientation of the protein. 


 \subsubsection{Effect of protein orientation}

 Until this point we always kept the orientation of the proteins such that the dipole moment was parallel to the $y$-axis. In this 
 section we explore the effects of the protein orientation respect to the nanoparticle in the LSPR response. For this study we use the 
 volume equivalent ellipsoids in three different orientations: the original configuration where the dipole moment is parallel to 
 the $y$-axis, a configuration such that the principal axis $a$ is parallel to $y$-axis, 
 and finally a configuration where the principal axis $b$ is parallel to $y$ (see Figure \ref{fig:two_ve_conf_display} for display configurations). Figure \ref{fig:two_ell_mult_config}
 show the LSPR response to the proteins/ellipsoids for the different orientations.

    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.65\textwidth]{viz/two_ve_conf_display.pdf} 
    \caption{Different configurations for two volume equivalent ellipsoids.}

 \end{figure}

     "VE ell a//y": principal axis $a$ is parallel to $y$-axis, and "VE ell b//y": principal axis $b$ is parallel to $y$-axis}
     \label{fig:two_ell_mult_config}
  \end{figure}
 
Figure \ref{fig:two_ell_mult_config} show the LSPR response of a silver nanoparticle and how it changes when the ellipsoids 
are placed in different orientations. The peak when the dipole moment is parallel to the $y$-axis (original)
is $3815.72$ $nm^2$ and occurs at $384.75$ nm, causing a shift of $0.75$ nm. When the orientation of the ellipsoid 
is such that $a//y$, the maximum value is $3802.51$ $nm^2$ and it happens at $385$ nm, which results in a shift of 
$1$ nm. The final orientation we study is when $b//y$ which has a peak of $3898.10$ $nm^2$ at $384.375$ nm, resulting 
in a shift of $0.375$ nm. These results tell us that the orientation of the protein affects the LSPR response, we can 
see that the shifts vary depending the orientation, as well as the intensity of the peak. When using a spherical model, 
all these effects are not capture due to the nature of the geometry, which can lead to misleading conclusions.

\subsubsection{Effect of number of proteins}

In this section we study the effect of having multiple proteins around the nanoparticle. Even though we know 
that volume equivalent ellipsoids are over estimating the response, they still account for the effects of 
orientation and they can give us an estimation on how the LSPR response changes when having multiple 
ellipsoids. We use the same orientations showed in Figure \ref{fig:two_ve_conf_display} but we added ellipsoids 
at $\pm 1$ nm in the $x$ and $y$ directions too. Figure \ref{fig:mult_ell} show the results of the LSPR response 
of six ellipsoids located atv$\pm 1$ nm in the $x$, $y$, and $z$-axis, for different orientations. 
 
\begin{figure} %[h] %  figure placement: here, top, bottom, or page

            located at $\pm 1$ nm of the nanoparticle in the $x$, $y$ and $z$-axis.}
    \label{fig:mult_ell}
 \end{figure}

 The peak when the dipole 
 moment is parallel to the $y$-axis (original) is $3673.89$ $nm^2$ and occurs at $385.375$ nm, causing a shift of 
 $1.375$ nm. When the orientation of the ellipsoid is such that $a//y$, the maximum value is $3643.97$ $nm^2$ and it
 happens at $385.5$ nm, which results in a shift of $1.5$ nm. The final orientation we study is when $b//y$ which 
 has a peak of $3814.23$ $nm^2$ at $384.625$ nm, resulting in a shift of $0.625$ nm. We can see that adding more proteins, 
 regardless the orientation, increases the shift. However, depending on the orientation the percentage of shift increment 
 varies. When we go from two ellipsoids on $\pm 1$ nm on the $z$-direction to six ellipsoids located at 
 $\pm 1$ nm in the $x$, $y$, and $z$-axis we see an increment on the shift of:
 
 \begin{itemize}
     \item {$~83\%$ when the dipole moment is parallel to the $y$-axis}
     \item {$50\%$ when the principal axis $a$ is parallel to the $y$-axis}
     \item {$~66.67\%$ when the principal axis $b$ is parallel to the $y$-axis}
 \end{itemize}    
 
\subsubsection{Effect of magnitude of electric field}

Another effect we study is the effect of the magnitude of the incident electric field. For 
all the simulations of this work we the magnitude of the electric field from Phan and 
coworkers \cite{PhanETal2013}. We did not find other values in the literature that we can compare to since
it was not reported. In this section we vary the magnitude of the electric field across several order of magnitudes 
and study its effect on the LSPR response.

    electric field where the units are $[e]/([{\text{\AA}}^2][\epsilon_0])$. The bottom figure is a zoom of the top 
    figure.}
    \label{fig:efield effect}
 \end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:efield effect} shows how the magnitude of the incident electric field affects the LSPR response 
of a silver nanoparticle of radius $r=8$ nm when having a volume equivalent ellipsoid located 
$\pm 1$ nm in the $z$-direction. We can see that as we decrease the magnitude of the electric field, 
the intensity of the extinction cross section increases. For all the different values of electric field except 
$1\times10^{-5}$ the peak occurs at $384.25$ nm, when the magnitude is $1\times10^{-5}$ the peak occurs at 
$384.5$ nm. This tells us that the magnitude of the electric field affects the shift. We computed 
the magnitude of the electric field due to the single charge inside the ellipsoid, on the surface of the nanoparticle,
and we found that its magnitude is $~5.4 \times 10^{-4}$ $[e]/([{\text{\AA}}^2][\epsilon_0])$. Therefore, 
when the magnitude of the incident electric field is smaller than the magnitude of the electric field generated by 
the protein on the surface of the nanoparticle, the shift increases. It is worth mentioning that if there are no charges 
present in the protein, the extinction cross section does not varies when the magnitude of the incident electric field 
changes. 


\section{Dielectric study}

Most computational works in the literature use a constant real dielectric value both in the protein and the
embedding medium \cite{NghiemETal2012, SantiagoCordobaETal2011,UngerETal2009}, such modeling does not count for the losses 
in that medium. LSPR biosensors detect a target molecule by monitoring plasmon resonance frequency changes due to the proximity 
of the target to the metallic nanoparticle. In this section we show how the LSPR response changes when choosing different models 
for the dielectric in the protein and the medium around the system sensor-protein. We use the same setup used in chapter \ref{chap:lspr_response_bsa}
where we have two BSA proteins located at $\pm$ 1 nm on the $z$-direction of a silver nanoparticle of radius $r=8$ nm (see 
Figure \ref{fig:display_z}). The system sensor-protein is submerged in water and under a constant electric field of 
$0.0037$ $[e]/([{\text{\AA}}^2][\epsilon_0])$ in the $z$-direction. We firstly study the effect of having a real-valued dielectric 
for the protein, by keeping the medium dielectric as complex, secondly we analyze the effect of the medium by using a real-valued 
dielectric for it but keeping the BSA dielectric complex, and finally we study the effect of certain combination where both the medium 
and the protein have real-valued dielectrics. We obtained the values for the real dielectric of the BSA and water (medium) from the literature,
in most cases they provided the refractive index $n$ which we convert to the real dielectric $e_r=n^2$:  

\paragraph{BSA dielectric values:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item {Nghiem et al 2012 \cite{NghiemETal2012}: $n=1.9$, $e_r = n^2 = 3.61$}
    \item {Santiago-Cordoba et al 2011 \cite{SantiagoCordobaETal2011}: $n=1.45$, $e_r = n^2 = 2.0125$}
    \item {Phan et al 2013 \cite{PhanETal2013}: Average of real values of complex Lorentz-Drude model $e_r = 2.7498$}
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Water dielectric values:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item {Real dielectric of water at room temperature $n=1.33$, $e_r = n^2 = 1.7689$}
    \item {Hale and Querry 1972 \cite{HaleQuerry1972}: Average of experimental real values $e_r = 1.7962$}
\end{itemize}
  
\subsection{BSA with real dielectric}

We study the effect of using a real-valued dielectric for the BSA, while keeping a complex-valued dielectric for the water where  
the system protein-sensor is embedded. Figure \ref{fig:bsa_diel} shows the extinction cross-section of silver nanoparticle 
of radius $r=8$ nm when having two BSA proteins located at $\pm1$ nm in the $z$-direction, for different dielectric models for the BSA. 
The computation of the original curve ("Complex") uses the complex dielectric for each frequency obtained from the Lorentz-Drude model 
from Phan et al. \cite{PhanETal2013}. The remaining curves correspond to the real-valued models from Santiago-Cordoba et al.\cite{SantiagoCordobaETal2011},
Nghiem et al \cite{NghiemETal2012}, and the average value of the real part from Phan et al. \cite{PhanETal2013}. The peak of the extinction cross section 
for both the complex model from Phan work \cite{PhanETal2013} and the average of its real part happen at $384.5$ nm, which represents a shift of $0.5$ nm from 
the isolated nanoparticle. However, the intensity of the peak goes from $3901.06$ nm$^2$ to $4063.95$ nm$^2$ which is approximately a $~4.2\%$ increment. 
The resonance peaks for the values from Nghiem et al. and Santiago-Cordoba et al. occur at wavelengths $384.75$ nm and $384$ nm, respectively. This translates in 
no shift for the case of Santiago-Cordoba et al., and a shift of $0.75$ nm for the case of Nghiem et al. Moreover, the intensity for these two cases is 
bigger than the case where we used a complex dielectric for the model.

    when using a complex vs a real dielectric for the protein.}
    \label{fig:bsa_diel}
 \end{figure}

The results from \ref{fig:bsa_diel}, tell us that using a real dielectric for the protein affects the intensity of the extinction cross section. Using 
different values for the real dielectric aso affects the LSPR response in terms of the shift. However, when comparing the complex model from Phan et al. versus
an average of the real parts of the dielectric, we see that the shift does not change. 

\subsection{Water with real dielectric}

After studying the effect of the dielectric model used inside the protein we wanted to explore the effects of the dielectric model in the 
embedding medium. We analyzed the effect of using a real-valued dielectric in the water when having the isolated nanoparticle (\ref{fig:iso_NP_diel}), 
as well as having the nanoparticle with two BSA proteins located at $\pm1$ nm on the $z$-direction (\ref{fig:real_w_comp_bsa}). For these results we used, 
the complex dielectric values obtained from Hale and Querry \cite{HaleQuerry1972}, the average value of the real part from their work, and the real 
dielectric value for water at room temperature commonly used in the literature ("Generalization"). Figure \ref{fig:iso_NP_diel} shows
that using a complex representation of the dielectric versus using the average across the wavelengths of its real part, is indistinct. We can see that the curves
for the complex dielectric case (black curve) and the averaged of the real part of the complex dielectric, match perfectly. However, when we change the value of 
the real dielectric it has a big impact on where the peak occurs. For the "Generalization" case, where the dielectric is $1.7689$ we see that the peak occurs at 
a wavelength of $382.75$ nm, compared to the original peak for a dielectric of $1.7962$ which happens at $384$ nm. This shows how sensitive is the LSPR response 
of the silver nanoparticle to the dielectric in which it is embedded. 
 
\begin{figure} %[h] %  figure placement: here, top, bottom, or page
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{iso_np_water_diel_study.pdf} 
    \caption{Comparison of LSPR response of isolated silver nanoparticle when using a complex 
     vs a real dielectric model for the water medium}
    \label{fig:iso_NP_diel}
 \end{figure}

Once we understood how the dielectric model affected the LSPR response of the isolated nanoparticle, we decided to study how this 
effect varies when adding the BSA proteins at $\pm1$ nm on the $z$-direction. To isolate the effect of the dielectric model on the 
medium, we use the complex dielectric from Phan et al. \cite{PhanETal2013} for the BSA proteins. Figure \ref{fig:real_w_comp_bsa}
shows the shift in the LSPR response of a silver nanoparticle (dashed lines) when adding the BSA proteins (full lines), for the same 
real dielectrics models used in Figure \ref{fig:iso_NP_diel}. When using the average of the real part of the complex dielectric from 
Hale and Querry \cite{HaleQuerry1972} the shift is $0.5$ nm which is the same value compared to the full complex model. However, when using 
the generalization of the water dielectric, the peak for the extinction cross section when the two BSA proteins are present occurs at a wavelength of 
$383.5$ nm, what gives us a shift in the LSPR response of $0.75$ nm. These results tell us that there is no difference in the LSPR response, if we wither use 
the complex dielectric for the water or an average of the real part of it. However, when using the a different real value for the dielectric, it not only 
affects the wavelength at which the resonance peaks occur but also the shift when proteins are added in the vicinity.

    when using a complex vs a real dielectric for the water medium.}
    \label{fig:real_w_comp_bsa}
 \end{figure}

 \subsection{BSA and water with real-valued dielectric}

Last but not least we study the effect of using real-valued dielectrics for the BSA proteins as well as the water medium. For the BSA proteins 
we used the average valued of the real component from Phan et al. \cite{PhanETal2013}, and for the protein medium we used both values  
use for the results in Figure \ref{fig:real_w_comp_bsa}. Figure \ref{fig:bsa_w_real} shows the results of using real dielectrics in both the proteins and
the water medium. The peaks in all cases occur at the same wavelengths compared to the case where we use a BSA complex dielectric for the protein, and as a 
consequence the shifts are the same than the ones reported in Figure \ref{fig:real_w_comp_bsa}. However, when we use real dielectric in both the medium 
and teh proteins we see an increment in the magnitude of the extinction cross section of $~4.2\%$ for the Hale and Querry case, and $~3.6\%$ for the 
generalization case. These results tells us that there is no difference between using a complex dielectric value for the protein and the medium, and using 
an averaged value of the real part, when it comes to the shift in the LSPR response. However, there is a difference in the magnitude of the 
extinction cross section that is a direct consequence of using a real-valued dielectric since this do not counts for the losses in the medium. Similarly to the 
results shown in Figure \ref{fig:real_w_comp_bsa}, the usage of a different real dielectric for the water medium, changes where the peak occurs and the shift in the 
LSPR response. 

 \begin{figure} %[h] %  figure placement: here, top, bottom, or page
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{bsa_phan_avg_real_water_diel.pdf} 
    \caption{Comparison of LSPR response of a silver nanoparticle to two BSA proteins located at $\pm1$ nm on the $z$-direction
    when using a real dielectric model in the protein and the water medium.}
    \label{fig:bsa_w_real}
 \end{figure}

In summary, when studying the LSPR response of a nanoparticle and how it shifts when proteins are in the vicinity, we can use 
a real dielectrics for the water medium and the BSA protein, if they come from an average of the real part of the complex dielectric model 
or experimental data (see Hale and Quarry results on Figure \ref{fig:bsa_w_real}). However, when using real-valued dielectrics for the medium 
and the protein, the intensity of the extinction cross section increases, which is a problem if the results are intended to be used for 
sensitivity calculations.
